Project 1:
Title: Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
Description:
This project detects fraudulent transactions using classification techniques on a credit card transactions dataset. It uses feature scaling, oversampling (SMOTE) for class imbalance, and RandomForest as the primary model. Evaluation emphasizes precision, recall and ROC-AUC to minimize false negatives and false positives.

Tech Stack:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn (SMOTE), Matplotlib, Seaborn, Joblib, Google Colab

Project 2:
Title: Lung Cancer Prediction using ANN and RandomForest
Description:
A healthcare-focused classification system to predict lung cancer (binary) from clinical features. The project applies preprocessing (encoding, scaling), trains a RandomForest baseline and an ANN (Keras), and evaluates using classification report and ROC-AUC.

Tech Stack:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Joblib, Google Colab


Project 3:
Title: Vehicle Price Prediction using Machine Learning (Regression)
Description:
This regression project predicts resale vehicle prices using features like year, brand, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. It demonstrates feature engineering, preprocessing for categorical variables, and a RandomForestRegressor pipeline with evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²).

Tech Stack:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost (optional), Matplotlib, Joblib, Google Colab
